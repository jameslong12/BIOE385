\subsection*{Office Hours}
\textit{BRC 230}: Wednesday and Thursday 4pm-5pm\\
Please email for appointments outside the above times.

\subsection*{Course Website}
The course website, which includes all necessary documents, is hosted on Github. You may access it through \href{https://jameslong12.github.io/BIOE385}{this link} or the following: \href{https://bit.ly/bioe385_f22}{bit.ly/bioe385\_f22}. Assignment submission and grading will be hosted on Canvas.

\subsection*{Course Description}
In this laboratory course, you will learn to design, build, and test biomedical instrumentation using the NI ELVIS hardware system and LabView software. Students will work in teams to complete two design projects: an Optical Immunoassay system and an EMG/Reflex measurement device. Mastery of instrumentation principles and the below course objectives will be evaluated with pre/in-lab assignments, reports, project demos, and written/practical lab exams.

\subsection*{Course Objectives}
By the end of the course, students will demonstrate the ability to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design, build, and troubleshoot electrical circuits to acquire engineering measurements.
	\item Analyze and present acquired data in a user-friendly manner.
	\item Solve open-ended engineering problems, taking resource constraints and design criteria into consideration.
	\item Communicate and justify engineering decisions and designs in a written document.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Prerequisites}
You must have successfully completed ELEC 243 and the associated lab course to complete this class. No exceptions.

\subsection*{Safety}
Laboratory environments include inherent dangers and thus strict compliance to safety measures is important. All students are expected to work safely and to ask for assistance when uncertain. Absolutely no eating, drinking or gum chewing will be allowed at any place or time in the lab.

\subsection*{Attendance Policy}
Students are required to attend ALL sessions of the laboratory. Exceptions for illness, family emergencies, or other excusable absences may be granted with instructor approval on a case-by-case basis. Any make-ups for valid absences must be done at the convenience of the instructor and your lab partner.

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}[h!]{cccc}
\toprule
	Category & Submissions & Total Points & \% Final Grade\\
	\midrule
	Pre-Labs/In-Labs & In class & 155 & 31\%\\
	Miscellaneous & In class & 25 & 5\%\\
	Lab Reports & Canvas & 120 & 24\%\\
	Project Demos & In class & 100 & 20\%\\
	Exams & In class & 100 & 20\%\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Penalties may be applied for the following violations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item -5 points: Unsafe laboratory practices, leaving lab area messy, or not returning components correctly (per event)
	\item -50 points: Failure to return lab supplies at the end of the semester. A complete list of supplies can be found \href{https://jameslong12.github.io/BIOE385/general_course_materials/supplies.pdf}{here}.
\end{itemize}

For a full list of assignments and due dates, \href{https://jameslong12.github.io/BIOE385/general_course_materials/assignments.pdf}{see here}.

\subsubsection*{Late Policy}
Pre-lab and In-lab assignments will not be accepted late without a valid excused absence. Late reports will be penalized 30\% of the assignment value per day.

\subsubsection*{Regrade Policy}
If you believe that an error was made in grading your assignments, you should write a \underline{short} justification of your claim and attach it to the original homework assignment. You can bring the documents to class or to my office (BRC 765).  Make sure to write your contact email so I can review your concern(s) and respond to you directly. The “statute of limitations” for submitting such claims is one week after the assignment was returned.  I will respond to re-grading requests – but note that the entire report might be re-graded, not just the section in question, in order to ensure consistency and fairness. 

\subsection*{Honor Code Policy}

Collaboration between group members is expected for the completion of high quality lab reports. However, you may not consult the materials from previous years' BIOE 383 or 385 courses, including but not limited to: written reports, posters, data calculations, and code. Additionally, while you may discuss aspects of the lab projects and reports with other groups, your group's submitted work must reflect your individual efforts. In other words, you cannot submit another group's work as your own, and these materials may include but are not limited to: writing, graphs, code, and data calculations. You cannot collaborate on lab exams.

In simpler terms, only submit work that is your own. If you need clarification, please contact the instructor \textit{prior to submission} to avoid an infraction. For a list of standard definitions as outlined by the Honor Council, please see \href{https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.rice.edu/dist/c/490/files/2022/08/Honor-Council-Standard-Definitions-and-Policies.pdf}{this link}.

\subsection*{Commitment to Equitable Learning}
This class is committed to an equitable learning environment. Accommodations will be made for students with alternative needs, but it is critical that you alert the instructor in advance of any additional resources you need prior to assignment submission and lab exams. In particular, you must notify the instructor of any alternative testing needs \textit{at least two weeks prior to an exam.} For additional resources and more information, please visit the \href{https://drc.rice.edu/}{Disability Resource Center} and the \href{https://aop.rice.edu/}{Access and Opportunity portal.}
