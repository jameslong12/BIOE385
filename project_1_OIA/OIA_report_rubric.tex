\section*{Description of Executive Summary}
As a part of your technical reports, you will write an executive summary. The purpose of an executive summary is to summarize your project’s status and orient your audience to the aims, methods, and implications of your project. \textit{It should be less than one page.}\\

Organize your summary to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What problem are you trying to solve?
	\item Why is solving this problem interesting or important?
	\item How will/does your design solve the problem?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How will/does it work and why did you choose this specific approach over other options?
	\end{itemize}
	\item How will/did you validate your design?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What surprises, new discoveries, or anomalies have/did you encounter?
		\item What do your performance results suggest about the solution you proposed?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Which device would you recommend to use for the final design and why?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What recommendations do you have for improving or building on your design?
		\item What do you plan to do next or what recommendations can you make to others that might conduct follow-up studies?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In many cases, the executive summary might be all that your boss or a decision-maker reads when evaluating your project and determining a course of action, so it’s important to be concise, yet thorough.
