\section*{In-lab Assignment}
During this week you should make sure your device is accurate and reliable. Use this time to test your device and collect the necessary data for your report. Make sure your LabView interface is user-friendly and allows you to collect data appropriately.

\begin{info}
A tip for your reports: real data in graphs is more convincing than general statements with no supporting evidence. Use this week to collect this necessary data.
\end{info}

For the lab test day, be sure you are ready and capable of explaining and demonstrating all aspects of your circuits and VI.\\

While there are no concrete deadlines and objectives to complete for the lab today, the only reason you would stop working is if everything works perfectly! So, be diligent during this time and you will be relieved of the need to cram and try to finish the lab project outside of lab time.
