\section*{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set default values for indicators and control the range (maximum and/or minimum value) that the user can manipulate
	\item Display data from different channels in the same graph or chart
	\item Merge and split signals
	\item Store results in a table (front panel) and save them into a file
	\item Use Inputs from the Express functions in LabView to acquire and simulate signals
	\item Use Structures, Arrays, Numeric, Boolean, Comparison, File I/O, Timing and Strings from the Programming functions in LabView to create user friendly VIs
	\item Justify the selection of components used in the circuits designed in lab
	\item Explain the LabView VI built to calculate reflex time
	\item Identify and describe the main limitations of your device
\end{enumerate}

\section*{In-lab Assignment}
This week is the time to finish up your assignment. You are tasked with making sure everything works together and that you have all the images and information that you need to compose your final report. Consider what additional features could be implemented now or be proposed as future improvements. Before you leave today, make sure the following are working:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hammer circuit
	\item EMG circuit
	\item LabView VI
\end{itemize}

Remember that your project and report are graded on sophistication and ease-of-use. With that in mind, use any extra time you have to make your project even better!
