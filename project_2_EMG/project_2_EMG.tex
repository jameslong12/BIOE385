\section*{Introduction}
You are a research engineer working at a major hospital in the Texas Medical Center. Your boss is interested in studying the reflex time associated with muscle response in patients with various neurological conditions. Your job is to create the biomedical instrumentation and documentation that is required to conduct the study.\\

\section*{Assignment}

The following features are necessary in your device:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The EMG signal must be collected with a circuit you design.
	\item You will have an instrumented reflex hammer for which you must also design appropriate circuitry.
	\item Each of these signals should be amplified and filtered appropriately and then collected simultaneously.
	\item You will display the data using LabView, and the user must be able to determine EASILY (if not in an automated manner) the time between the hammer strike and the muscle response.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Report Draft}
Each group will turn in a report draft for their EMG-Hammer device (\href{https://github.com/jlongc12/BIOE_385/blob/main/general_course_materials/syllabus.pdf}{see schedule in syllabus}). This draft will be evaluated by your peers and the instructor. The grade obtained in this assignment, as well as the quality of your evaluation of another group’s device, will contribute 20 points towards your grade.\\

The report draft will consist of 2 parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{User Manual}
	
	You must write a User Manual that enables a health care professional such as a paramedic or nurse to setup and run the device (\textit{only hardware}) without any previous training.\\
	
	Minimum requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Detailed table of contents for all sections included in the draft
		\item Summary and description of your device (\textit{only hardware})
		\item Clear instructions explaining how to setup and use the device along with pictures and guides that are easy to follow (\textit{only hardware})
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Technical Specifications}
	
	The second part of the report should include technical specifications that allow other engineering teams to understand how your device is designed, modify it and make further improvements when necessary.\\
	
	Minimum requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Appendices that include drawings of your circuits and explanations of technical aspects of the device.
		\item Challenges associated with the interaction between living and non-living systems.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Longer is NOT better for the purposes of this assignment. A clear, concise, well-written report is preferred. Be sure to review the detailed grading rubric for your report draft in the course website.

\section*{Final Report}
During the last week, each group will turn in a final EMG-Hammer Report for their device. You will also have the opportunity to demonstrate your device as part of the end of project test.\\

The final report will consist of 2 parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{User Manual}
	
	You must write a User Manual that enables a health care professional such as a paramedic or nurse to setup and run the device (\textit{hardware and LabView program}) without any previous training.\\
	
	Minimum requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Detailed table of contents
		\item Summary and description of your device 
		\item Clear instructions explaining how to setup and use the device along with pictures and guides that are easy to follow
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Technical Specifications}
	
	The second part of the report should include technical specifications that allow other engineering teams to understand how your device is designed, modify it and make further improvements when necessary.\\
	
	Minimum requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clear descriptions of the limitations of the device and any suggestions for improvements.
		\item Appendices that include the LabView Code, drawings of your circuits, and explanations of technical aspects of the device.
		\item Challenges associated with the interaction between living and non-living systems.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Longer is NOT better for the purposes of this assignment. A clear, concise, well-written report is preferred. Be sure to review the detailed grading rubric for your final report in the course website.
